If you can't read a simple error telling you where the config should go then you shouldn't be using this repo

here's my bot starting guide:
step 1: make a file called `config.json`
step 2: inside `config.json` add
```json
{
     "token": "your-token-here"
} 
```
step three: while inside the root dir of the project run `npx tsc` then enter the `build` directory and run the index.js file
